                TikTok username, refills are only applicable to the original Instagram/TikTok username provided at the
                time of ordering. Altering your username creates technical complexities in the delivery process, making
                it difficult for us to refill your followers under the new username.

                <br>
                <br>
                Follower Engagement and Unfollowing: Our service provides real Instagram and TikTok followers who are
                actual people with their own interests and priorities. While we strive to deliver engaged followers,
                it's important to understand that some followers may choose to unfollow your Instagram or TikTok account
                over time. We cannot guarantee that every follower will continue to follow your account indefinitely.
                <br>
                <br>
                Liability for Follower Drops: After the initial 30-day refill period, Superviral is not responsible for
                any drops in followers that may occur. The refill period allows for any substantial drop in follower
                count to be replenished at no additional cost. However, please be aware that beyond this period, any
                fluctuations in follower numbers are beyond our control.
                <br>
                <br>
                Instagram Algorithm and Policy Changes: It's essential to acknowledge that Instagram or TikTok, like any
                social media platform, may update its algorithms, policies, or features from time to time. These changes
                could impact various aspects of your Instagram or TikTok presence, including follower counts and
                engagement rates. As such changes are beyond our control, Superviral cannot be held responsible for any
                direct or indirect effects they may have on your Instagram or TikTok account.
                <br>
                <br>
                By using our Instagram Followers Service, you acknowledge and agree to the above conditions, including
                the understanding that Superviral is not liable for any changes Instagram or TikTok makes to its
                algorithms or policies that may affect your account metrics. Your use of Superviral services is also
                subject to our general Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
